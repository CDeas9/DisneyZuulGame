/**
 *  <p>
 *  This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 *  "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
 *  Users can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really 
 *  be extended to make it more interesting!
 * <p>
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the 
 *  "play" method.
 * <p>
 *  This main class creates and initialises many others: 
 *  it creates all rooms, 
 *  and creates the parser to process commands. 
 *  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
 * <p>
 *  Revised 2012.06.21 by William H. Hooper: 
 *  The game now receives all input via the processInput() method,
 *  and collects all output into the String messages.
 *  These changes allow the Game to be played by a test method,
 *  by a controller embedded in BlueJ,
 *  from the console,
 *  from an applet, etc.

     * Revisions 2012-06-27 by William H. Hooper
     * The following methods were deleted from the class:
     * 
     *      play() - Game play is now directed from the interface.
     *      getInput() - getting user input is now the job of the
     *          interface.
     *      
     * The following public methods were added to the class:
     * 
     *      processInput() - sends user input to the game
     *      readMessages() returns all the messages ready to be sent
     *      finished() - tells the calling interface 
     *          whether the game is over.
     *      
     *      print(), println(), - these methods replace System.out.* 
     *          methods, and redirect output to a message string.
     *          The calling interface reads the messages spooled and 
     *          controls how they are displayed.
